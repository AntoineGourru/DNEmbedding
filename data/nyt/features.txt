109	Banks' Leases To Hedge Funds Are Questioned  Regulators are questioning relationship between investment banks and hedge fund traders who lease hotel rooms from banks; question whether banks are using real estate relationship as way to entice hedge funds to do business with them, possibly at expense of their investors; Massachusetts secretary of state William F Galvin has subpoenaed giant Swiss Bank UBS and is examining other banks with hedge fund hotels in Boston to determine how they are charging for their services; he is looking at whether hedge funds are paying higher than normal trading fees to banks to compensate them for office space and failing to disclose this expense to investors; UBS has 400,000 square feet of hedge fund hotels in several cities; Bear Stearns has space for rent in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles; at issue is matter that has dogged regulators for decades; money managers, including mutual funds and hedge funds, often pay Wall Street with 'soft dollars'--inflated commissions that include cost of trading plus additional few cents a share that can be directd to pay for research and other services; soft dollars are controversial because clients pay for higher commissions, while services often benefit manager the most; higher comissions result in greater expenses for fund and potentially lower returns for investors (M)
